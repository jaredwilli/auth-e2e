# Authentication End to End Example

This is a project that was built from the course on Udemy [Advanced React and Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/learn/v4/overview). The course covers a few different very useful areas of web development. This repository contains the code from the part that shows how to build a full end to end user authentication system using React and Node.js.
